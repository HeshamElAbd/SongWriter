I don't know why I'm gonna be free  
  
I got the same to live another day  
But I'm so glad I know it's gonna be no reason  
I'm coming home  
I can't let go  
I got to go away  
I know that we really love you  
I ain't got no road  
I'm gonna be the only one  
  
I know we're getting down  
I'm still a fool  
I can't see the world  
I want to be the one  
I would be the care of you  
The only one you want to say that you're still alive  
You're all alone  
I want you to be alone  
I've got to do it all again  
You can tell me what I'm talking to you  
  
I want to love you  
Like you can see  
I'm gonna get it out  
I'm gonna be love somebody to love  
Oh yeah  
  
I believe in you  
I know you love me  
I see you again  
  
All that I see is fair  
I want to be here to show you all I want  
And I won't let it be  
I want you to get it  
  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
I got a bottle of the night  
When you want to be a smile  
The change of mine  
You say it's hard to see
