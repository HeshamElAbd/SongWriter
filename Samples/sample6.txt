Just a little bit of being out of this love  
See I'm alone  
  
Hold me now  
  
And you won't be the one  
  
I know you're here to run away  
  
Oh you got to take me  
And I will cry  
I want you to know where I want to be  
Give me a woman  
I want to be your love  
  
I said you want me to be  
  
I want to tell you what you need  
I don't want to try to give  
I don't know why I knew you want to be  
I want to know what I want you  
I said I'm on my own  
I'm walking in the corner  
I'm finally free  
I want to be the same  
We won't take a little time  
I need you anyway  
I don't want to live  
I know you want me  
  
I wanna be alright,  
I'll be your love  
I know you got a country  
  
[Chorus]  
I say I'm gonna make it the best thing I do  
I love the way you feel like I can see  
I wanna be your motherfucker  
When you are the sound of my life  
But the storm will find it  
I want to know why I can't say  
  
There's a little stranger in the middle of the loser  
They
