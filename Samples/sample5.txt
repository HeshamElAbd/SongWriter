 it out  
  
Come on, come on, come on now  
I'm sure that you're so good  
You're only a chance  
  
You can see your man  
I can't stand to stand by you  
Oh yeah  
  
This is my life  
This is my bed  
  
I wanna be a man  
Oh no, I wanna be a man  
  
[Chorus]

 % $ I could never be a damn stranger  
  
I don't want to feel  
I'm gonna tell you why  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I was waiting for the stream  
(I want to know that you're a little bit life)  
When you want some more  
I'll be too late  
  
You can be the one that I know  
  
I said the sun is real  
I have reached the world  
  
I'm here to get there  
I'm a fool for family  
I'm a long time  
I'm on the line  
  
I can't stop standing in this love  
  
I hope it's hard to love you  
If you want to  
I can't read my name  
  
I don't know why  
That's a thing that I did not  
And I'm just a little bit of your lover  
And the light is strong  
I know that we all can see  
We will stay and let you be  
  
Let's get it on the reign
