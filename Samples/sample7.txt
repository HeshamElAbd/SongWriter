[Chorus]

I don't know what I do  
I'm a man and the sun is over  
I got a million miles  
  
I'm still a fool  
I can't leave you  
I want to see you again

I'm gonna take you on my back  
Cause I'm made of beautiful  
That you see me crying  
I'm the same old man

I want to get to you  
But you know I
